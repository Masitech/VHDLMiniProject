@note: top-level test bench can be used to simulate all of the individual files 
@note: Where it says _short on the file name indicates the simulation has not ran for the full time frame of >1 second

Phase Shifter 
- Simulate for at least 5 ms since the SI signal is quite slow. Then Zoom out a lot. 

Top Level Phase Shift
- Need to simulate at least for 1 second. This will take a very long time, hence i did a short simulation. This is because SI is sampled 
for 1 second before the frequency is calculated and displayed on the screen. 

Frequency Calculator 
- Again has to be simulated for 1 second or more (above reason) 

Display Interface 
- Can be difficult to understand, it works. 

bCounter 
- No special requirement. TB only up to x1000 to get data for x100000 to use the top-level test bench
Div2 
- No special requirement 

Sync
- No special requirement 

Sync 2
- No special requirement
